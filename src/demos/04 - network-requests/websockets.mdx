A WebSocket is a persistent connection that remains active. Data can be passed back and forth between the client and server, much like a standard
network socket.

This demo uses a public WebSocket echo service. Click "Connect". Once connected, enter a message in the field below and click "Send". 

All sent and received messages will be shown in the "Log" area. With an echo service, you will see each message you type sent then immediately sent back from the server.

You can also see data being sent and received in the Network tab of your browser developer tools.
