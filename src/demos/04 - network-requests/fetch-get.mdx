For a basic `GET` request, the newer Fetch API is much simpler than `XMLHttpRequest` to work with. Unlike `XMLHttpRequest`, Fetch works with `Promise`s. 

The initial `fetch` call returns a promise that resolves to the response object. To get the JSON response body, we call `response.json()` which returns another `Promise`. Finally, that gives us the JSON response.

We'll use a `fetch` call to interact with the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).
