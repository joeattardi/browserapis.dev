The `XMLHttpRequest` API is an event-based API used to send asynchronous HTTP requests. Despite its name, it is most commonly used to request JSON data.
It's an older API that isn't as elegant to work with as an alternative like the Fetch API, but still works perfectly well when needed.

We'll use an `XMLHttpRequest` to interact with the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).
