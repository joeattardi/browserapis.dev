This demo shows the basics of interacting with `Promise` objects. When you enter a 
user ID and click the Search Users button, it calls a function that makes a request
to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).

Behind the scenes, this is done with the Fetch API. Fetch is covered in more detail in 
[Chapter 4, Network Requests](/demos/network-requests).
