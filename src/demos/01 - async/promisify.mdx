summary: 'Create a Promise wrapper around the event-based XMLHttpRequest API.'

This example shows how you can take an asynchronous API that uses events, such as `XMLHttpRequest`, and wrap it in a helper function that returns a `Promise`.

Enter a person ID (a number), or use the one that has been pre-filled. Click Submit, and the person with that ID will be fetched from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev), a public API that's good for testing purposes.
