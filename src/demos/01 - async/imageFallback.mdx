summary: 'Load an image and show it once loaded. In case of error, show a fallback image.'
---

The `loadImage` function takes an image URL and a fallback. It returns a `Promise` and tries to load the image from the given URL.

If the image failed to load, and a fallback URL was given, it will attempt to load the fallback image instead. If that fails, or no fallback URL was given, the `Promise` is rejected.

If either the image or the fallback successfully loaded, the `Promise` is resolved with the `Image` object, ready to add to the document.
