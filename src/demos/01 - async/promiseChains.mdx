This demo makes multiple asynchronous calls and builds a `Promise` chain. Each `Promise` success handler
returns a new `Promise`, which forms the chain. It uses the Star Wars API to load the name of a person's homeworld.

When you enter a person ID and click the Get Homeworld button, it calls the Star Wars API to load the person object.
When the person data is received, it contains the URL for the homeworld. Upon success, it calls this next API to
load the homeworld details.

Finally, the name and homeworld are shown.
