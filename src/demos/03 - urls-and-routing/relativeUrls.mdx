This is an example of basic client-side routing using the history API.

Clicking a link will change the URL by calling `history.pushState` and replace the app contents with the new route.
If the user clicks the browser's Back or Forward button, we handle the `popstate` event to show the proper content.
This is all done on the client side only. Other than the initial page load, no requests are sent to the server.
