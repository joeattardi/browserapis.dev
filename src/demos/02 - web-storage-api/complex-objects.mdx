This to-do list is a little more complex. Tasks can have due dates assigned. These are stored as `Date` objects,
which are properly serialized to and from JSON by using replacer and reviver functions.

When serialized to JSON, the `Date` objects are converted to timestamps with a `toJSON` function. 
When parsing back from JSON, we use a reviver function that passes this timestamp to a new `Date` constructor.

 - Enter a description and select a due date, then click Add.
 - Refresh the page. The due date should be preserved.
