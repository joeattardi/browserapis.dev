You can store nested objects with IndexedDB. Unlike with web storage, you don't need to
convert anything to a string. In this demo, we have a user profile form whose data is saved to IndexedDB. When
the page is loaded or refreshed, it will check IndexedDB for a saved profile. If one is found, the form will be
populated with the saved values.

Some key differences from using local or session storage:

- `JSON.stringify` is not required. The object itself is stored in the database.
- Nested objects are supported. In this demo, the address fields are collected into a nested object.
- Complex objects such as `Date`s can be directly persisted without any kind of serialization.
