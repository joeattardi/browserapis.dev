This example demonstrates a simple contact list application. The supported operations are:

 - **Get all contacts**: To get the contact list, we open a read-only transaction for the object store and use the `getAll` method
to load all records.
 - **Add a contact**: We open a read-write transaction and write the new contact object to the database.
 - **Delete a contact**: Here we also use a read-write transaction, and delete the contact by its ID.
 - **Search contacts**: We use an IndexedDB *cursor* to traverse the records and find the ones matching our query.
