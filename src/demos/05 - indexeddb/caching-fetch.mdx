Because IndexedDB can store entire JavaScript objects, we can use it to cache JSON objects from an HTTP request.

Here, we'll use the Fetch API to request people from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). When we receive a
person's data, we'll cache it in IndexedDB. Next time that person is requested, we can return the cached version
instead.
