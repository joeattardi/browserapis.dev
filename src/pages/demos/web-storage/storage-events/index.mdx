A simplified to-do list that persists its data in local storage.

 - Enter some text and press Enter to add a to-do.
 - The list only contains incomplete to-dos. When a to-do is marked completed, it is immediately removed.
 - The list data will be kept in sync with other browser tabs.

Open <Link to="/demos/web-storage/storage-events" target="_blank">this page in a second tab</Link>.
When to-do items are added or removed from a given tab, any other open tabs will be kept in sync. This is done by listening
for the `storage` event.

You can also open the JavaScript console to see notifications when storage events are triggered.
